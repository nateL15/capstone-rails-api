Created with Ember.js, Ruby on Rails, deployed to Heroku and version controlled on GitHub.

Unsolved problems that I would solve in the future: Allowing users to make resources private or public. Adding more routes to make Update form appear on its own page. Collapsable menus. Eventually integrating a 3rd party API for more robust information.

I planned to just hit minimum requirements with this project, as I knew taking on Ember.js would be a challenge with having only learned the basics of it a week ago. It defintely proved to be a challenge to me, basic CRUD actions now were approached completely differently.
I think overall it was beneficial to dip into Ember, as I learned how building a site could be incredibly fast if I became accustomed to Ember's way of doing things.
